# Project Status Summary (v2.0 Archive)
Date: 2025-12-21

## 1. Architecture Overview (Modular)
We moved from a monolithic `app.py` to a structured approach:
- **`core/`**: Functionally independent modules.
    - `detector.py`: YOLOv8n wrapper (Verified working).
    - `tracker.py`: Centroid tracking logic (Verified working).
    - `roi_logic.py`: "Box Mode" counting with stuck detection.
    - `sku_engine.py`: SKU management (JSON based).
    - `inventory.py`: Persistent storage and batch verification.
- **`dashboard/`**: Streamlit UI.
    - `app.py`: Restored to the "Classic" Layout (Tabs: Home, ROI, Inventory, Logs) but powered by the new `core` modules via a `LogisticsEngine` wrapper.

## 2. Key Achievements in this Version
1.  **Phase 2 Core Verification**: We built and verified the vision pipeline `phase2_test.py` in isolation, proving the camera and counting logic work without UI overhead.
2.  **Threaded Pipeline**: The `LogisticsEngine` class successfully decoupled the 30FPS vision loop from the Streamlit UI re-render loop, preventing lag.
3.  **Feature Restoration**: Fully restored the requested Tab layout, Settings, and Logs view.

## 3. Reason for Reset
- User requested a fresh start to ensure a clean slate, possibly to re-implement with an even stricter bottom-up approach or different design philosophy.

## 4. Archived Files
All files from this version have been moved to `_legacy_v2_archive/`.
